AUCOP-guitarToy16x is a guitar-oriented effect plugin, with 16x oversampled distortion and a simple (and weird!) pre-filter.

USE:
gT16x is a mono guitar effect. So one-in, one-out audio channels.

Click on the Preset buttons to reset the parameters (Unclick "Use Buffer" to access presets). These are loaded from a text file at start-up. 

Otherwise, it's a plugin; change the values, play your guitar.

Parameters:
-------General Section---------
Pre-Level: Input level, before any processing.
Gain: Distortion gain.
Squash Peaks: Asymmetrically down-scale the peaks after the first level of distortion is appled. This does lower amplitude, so compensate with Level.
Low Pass In: Low-pass filter applied after up-sampling.
Low Pass Out: Low-pass filter applied before down-sampling.
Scale: Perform a destructive Pre and Post scaling of the signal, before the distortion and after.
Resonance: Set the resonance of the low-pass filter, immediately after up-sampling.

-------Preset section-----------
Use Buffer: Click for preset values "on load". These will either be the Camomile defaults, or the values saved and restored by the host (I.E., preset values saved in a DAW or FX chain in a plugin host).
Preset: Click for preset in current Bank.
Bank: Click to select Bank.

-------Filter section-----------
LFO Freq: The filter has an optional LFO to alter the center frequency. On/Off enables/disables the LFO.
LFO Sweep Range: The center frequency is shifted by this amount by the LFO.
Freq Center: Filter center frequency.
Filter Q: The Q value of the filter.
Filter Mix: Alter the filter mix between Band-Pass and Low-Pass.
Mix Amount: Mix the filtered signal with the incoming signal.
Level: Overall volume output level.

-------Patch specific-----------
Load Patch File: Loads a bank of patches.
