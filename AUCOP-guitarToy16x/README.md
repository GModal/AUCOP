### Installation

Sorry, no install script yet...

#### All

- All: copy the .AUCOP directory to the home path "~/". This only holds preset files currently.

#### Linux Plugins

- LV2: copy the LV2 directory ("AUCOP-guitarToy16x.lv2") to the ~/.lv2 directory in your home dir. Or to the system LV2 directory.
- VST3: copy the vst3 directory ("AUCOP-guitarToy16x.vst3") to the ~/.vst3 directory in home dir. Or to the system VST3 directory.

#### Pure Data

- Copy the contents of the "pd" directory wherever is convenient.

#### Camomile

- Copy the contents of the "camomile" directory to the "Examples" folder in your Camomile install.

## Plugin use (copy of Info.txt)

AUCOP-guitarToy16x is a guitar-oriented effect plugin, with 16x oversampled distortion and a simple (and weird!) pre-filter.

### Use

gT16x is a mono guitar effect. So one-in, one-out audio channels.

Click on the Preset buttons to reset the parameters (Unclick "Use Buffer" to access presets). These are loaded from a text file at start-up. 

Otherwise, it's a plugin; change the values, play your guitar.

## Parameters

### General Section

- Pre-Level: Input level, before any processing.
- Gain: Distortion gain.
- Squash Peaks: Asymmetrically down-scale the peaks after the first level of distortion is appled. This does lower amplitude, so compensate with Level.
- Low Pass In: Low-pass filter applied after up-sampling.
- Low Pass Out: Low-pass filter applied before down-sampling.
- Scale: Perform a destructive Pre and Post scaling of the signal, before the distortion and after.
- Resonance: Set the resonance of the low-pass filter, immediately after up-sampling.

### Preset section

- Use Buffer: Click for preset values "on load". These will either be the Camomile defaults, or the values saved and restored by the host (I.E., preset values saved in a DAW or FX chain in a plugin host).
- Preset: Click for preset in current Bank.
- Bank: Click to select Bank.

### Filter section

- LFO Freq: The filter has an optional LFO to alter the center frequency. On/Off enables/disables the LFO.
- LFO Sweep Range: The center frequency is shifted by this amount by the LFO.
- Freq Center: Filter center frequency.
- Filter Q: The Q value of the filter.
- Filter Mix: Alter the filter mix between Band-Pass and Low-Pass.
- Mix Amount: Mix the filtered signal with the incoming signal.
- Level: Overall volume output level.

#### Notes:
A post-distortion filter is appled before the signal is upsampled. It's currently set to a low frequency, to suppress higher harmonic alias issues.

This corresponds (very) loosely to the frequency response of guitar speakers.

### Changes in 0.1.71


- New parameters have been added.
- The preset file format has changed.
- The post-upsampling low-pass filter schema has changed -- it's now a biquad~ filter object, replacing the two-stage filter used previously.
- The presets have been rewritten due to the low-pass filter change.
- Preset files can be load (usually stored in ~/.AUCOP/).
- The plugin versions include a buffer filled at load time by the plugin host. Previous versions reset when the preset file was loaded. This was an important oversight in the first release.


### Thoughts About AUCOP-guitarToy16x

GuitarToy was conceived as a low-impact guitar "enhancer," a plugin that would offer a good basic guitar sound but not be overloaded with features. I always follow it with a reverb or delay effect. There are so many good and optimized reverbs, better to use an existing one.

It's evolved into something not-quite-so-low-impact, but that's due to moving from 8x to 16x oversampling. IMO the 16x version sounded so much better, the extra processing overhead is worth the cost.

A simple, custom distortion function uses the expr~ object, but mostly as a conditional statement and not for number crunching.

The filtering is done before upsampling to conserve cpu cycles. It's also an unusual filter setup; it's somewhat counter-intuitive, but sounds pretty nice. It also includes an LFO sweep function. I included this to add some subtle "motion" to the sound, but it can give more overt effects (LFO wha, or phase shifting "like" sounds).

The presets are loaded from a text file inside the plugin (or Pd) folder. It's named "gtPresets_V2.txt" (previous versions "gtPresets.txt") and can be edited with any text editor. Here's the V2 parameter order & values for a preset patch:

#### Parameters Order, txt file:

1) Pre-Level: 1.0 - 50.0
2) Gain: 0.1 - 85.0
3) Level: 0.0 - 1.1
4) Resonance: 0.1 - 4.0 
5) Squash Peaks: 0.0 - 1.0
6) Scale: 0 - 5
7) LFO On/Off: 0 - 1
8) LFO Frequency: 0.0 - 5.0
9) LFO Sweep Range: 0.0 - 350.0
10) Frequency Center: 50.0 - 1500.0
11) Filter Q: 0.1 - 12.0
12) Filter Mix: 0.0 - 1.0
13) Mix Amount: 2.0 - -10.0
14) Lowpass In: 200.0 - 4400.0
15) Lowpass Out: 800.0 - 3800.0
16) Name: symbol string, no spaces

Patch parameters are separated by spaces, and each patch terminated with a semicolon. These specs are fairly typically when parsing text files within Pure Data.
